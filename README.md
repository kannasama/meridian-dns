# Meridian DNS

A high-performance DNS control plane built in C++ that serves as the single source of truth for DNS records across multiple providers. Manages internal and external infrastructure from a unified interface with split-horizon views, a variable template engine, and GitOps-style version control.

> **Status:** Pre-implementation — architecture and design are complete; codebase scaffolding is in progress.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Provider Management** — orchestrate DNS records across providers like PowerDNS, Cloudflare, and DigitalOcean through an extensible provider interface
- **Split-Horizon Views** — define internal and external views for the same domain, with strict isolation ensuring internal records never leak to external providers
- **Variable Template Engine** — store records with `{{var_name}}` placeholders; update a variable once and propagate to all affected records across all views
- **Preview-Before-Deploy Pipeline** — diff staged changes against live provider state, detect drift, and review before pushing
- **Deployment Snapshots and Rollback** — every push captures a full zone snapshot; roll back to any previous state (full zone or cherry-picked records)
- **GitOps Mirror** — after every deployment, the expanded zone state is committed to a Git repository as a human-readable backup
- **Audit Trail** — every mutation logged with before/after state, actor identity, and authentication method
- **Enterprise Authentication** — local accounts, OIDC, SAML 2.0, and API keys with full RBAC (admin / operator / viewer)
- **Client Interfaces** — Web GUI for visual diff review and variable management; separate TUI client (FTXUI) for keyboard-driven terminal workflows

## Quick Start

See [Build Environment](docs/BUILD_ENVIRONMENT.md) for the full setup guide.

```bash
# Install dependencies (Arch Linux / EndeavourOS)
paru -S --needed \
    base-devel git cmake ninja gcc \
    postgresql-libs libpqxx \
    openssl libgit2 nlohmann-json \
    spdlog
# Crow (HTTP server) is fetched automatically via CMake FetchContent — no system package needed

# Build
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=20
cmake --build build --parallel

# Run tests
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```
